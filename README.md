# simon-html
HTML only version of Simon. This demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements for structure, formatting, input, output, and drawing.

Because we are not using any CSS for styling we are limited on how visually pleasing our application is. Do not worry about that. At this point we are simply trying to provide structure and content that we will later style and make interactive.

Do the following:

* Clone this repository to your development machine.
* Review the code and feel comfortable with everything it represents.
* Make modifications to the code as desired. Experiment and see what happens.
* Create a new empty repository in your GitHub account. Make sure it is public.
* Clone your new repository to your development environment.
* In your new repository create your own version of the project. Refer to the example class project repository if you get stuck. 
* Periodically commit and push your code to your repository as you hit different milestones. (4 commits are required for full credit.)
* Change the footer link to point to your code repository.
* Make sure your project is visible through your repository GitHub Pages URL.
* When you have completed your version. Do a final push of your code and submit the GitHub Pages URL for your project for grading.
